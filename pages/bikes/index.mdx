## My E-Bikes

My current e-bikes are:

1. [VanMoof X3](bikes/vanmoof-x3): great all-around/starter city bike. One size fits all, [automatic shifting](bikes.md#x3-shifting), ["boost" button](bikes.md#boost-button) for quick starts. [$83/mo](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/payment-plans) includes [theft replacement, insurance, maintenance](bikes.md#x3-plan).
2. [Brompton Electric](bikes/brompton-electric): most compact fold, easy to bring into buildings/stores, great all-around city bike, one size fits all.
3. [Tern Vekton Q9](bikes/tern-vektron): folding cargo bike, one size fits all.
4. [Specialized Creo](bikes/specialized-creo): electric road-bike; light and fast, long range.

Each is useful in different contexts, and together they cost less than half [the $40k average new car in the US](./#cost) (see below for [starter packs from $2k or $83/mo](./#starter-packs), 1/20th to 1/10th the avg new car price).

I'll probably [end up with 1 or 2 more](bikes.md#other-ebikes). In particular, I want the ability to take people+cargo on rides that would otherwise require an SUV (which might still be worse in various ways, and would definitely cost much more), so [I'm eyeing a RadWagon](bikes.md#radwagon).
