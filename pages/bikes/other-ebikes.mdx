# Other Notable E-bikes

Some other models I've looked at or helped people buy:

## Specialized Turbo Vado SL ("Vado")

[The Vado](https://www.specialized.com/turbo-vado-sl) the "hybrid" (straight handlebars, but fast like a roadbike) version of [my "Creo" electric roadbike](bikes.md#creo) (part of [the Specialized "Turbo" ebike line discussed above](bikes.md#specialized-turbo)). It has the same motor/battery system that I love from the Creo, and is also just an incredible machine. It has essentially all the speed/range/quality of the Creo, but you can put a rack and panniers on it and haul stuff / use it around a city a bit more easily.

My sister-in-law has a [Vado 4.0 SL EQ](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-vado-sl-4-0-eq/p/170202), and my mother-in-law has [a "step-through" version](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-vado-sl-4-0-step-through-eq/p/188206). I've been thinking about getting a [Vado 5.0 SL EQ](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/turbo-vado-sl-5-0-eq/p/154892) (newer model, has a couple nice features over the 4.0 (like [the "Future Shock" handlebar suspension](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/future-shock)).

## RadWagon

[The RadWagon](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/products/radwagon-electric-cargo-bike) is a true cargo e-bike (as opposed to [my Vektron Q9](bikes.md#q9), which has less capacity and power, as a foldability tradeoff) for just $1900. [RadPower is aggressively targeting a mainstream price point](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/), seemingly mimicking Tern designs but with less premium components and a more mass-market focus.

This is a leading contender for my 5th e-bike, since I still have occasional cargo/hauling needs beyond what I can accomplish with my Q9, and it is so aggressively priced.

## Gocycle

[Gocycle](https://gocycle.com/) make cool/sporty/design-y folding ebikes. They seemed a bit expensive and lacking in hauling capacity for what I needed when I demo'd them, but could be good commuter bikes.

## Qualisports Dolphin

A friend recently got a [Qualisports Dolphin](https://www.qualisports.us/products/dolphin); it seems like a good commuter bike: cheap ($1400), powerful, has a throttle.

## Carbo Model X

The [Carbo Model X](https://ridecarbo.com/products/carbo-model-x) had [a huge crowdfund campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/carbo-the-world-s-lightest-folding-electric-bike#/), and the specs seem like the best of several worlds (folding, lightweight carbon, powerful motor, large battery; an e-folder that's 10lbs lighter than the Brompton, and more powerful).

I was able to test-ride one at [Greenpath](https://goo.gl/maps/Tvo7Hm1KHjgHFgc57) in Brooklyn; I felt like I might miss having multiple gears, and the carbon frame had some flex to it that I found a bit disconcerting. I've heard that low-quality carbon frames can fail in catastrophic ways, so I ultimately decided to let the "carbon e-folder" space mature / dust-settle for a bit before looking at it again. I had recently narrowly missed clicking "buy" on United City Bikes' "The One", which was a similar crowdfunded low-cost carbon e-folder, only to [have them liquidate the company the next day](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedcitybikes/comments/m883o4/unitedcitybikescom_down/grn4t4a) ðŸ˜­!

Things are moving fast in ebike-land, and there's something to be said for going with reputable brands and stores you can go to for service!
