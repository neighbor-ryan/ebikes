# VanMoof X3
The [VanMoof X3](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/x3) is an excellent all-around / starter e-bike, with many great/unique features:
* ["Boost" button](bikes.md#boost-button): extra pedal assist, makes starting+stopping easy+fast
* [Automatic shifting](bikes.md#x3-shifting): very convenient in urban settings with frequent starts/stops
* ["Peace of Mind" plan](bikes.md#x3-plan): theft protection/replacement, insurance, maintenance
* [Internal lock + alarm](bikes.md#x3-lock): nice first line of defense; coupled with [a "Peace of Mind" plan](bikes.md#x3-plan), makes it easier to take+leave places

[An $83/mo payment plan](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/payment-plans) includes theft replacement, insurance, and maintenance, though you may want to be within range of a VanMoof shop (I recommend [booking a test ride](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/test-rides) if you are!)

The battery is not removable, so you need to be able to keep the bike somewhere where you also charge it.

## "Boost button"

When you press or hold this button on the handlebar, the pedal assist is amplified for a few seconds. It's great for accelerating from a stop, or holding a line in traffic.

It's one of my favorite features on all my ebikes; I've noticed I am an extra curteous rider on my VanMoof because stopping and starting again is no sweat, thanks to the boost button.

## Automatic Shifting

VanMoofs automatically shift gears for you, based on your speed, which makes for a simpler/carefree riding experience. I really appreciate it when city riding; on my other bikes I shift down and then up again, sometimes by multiple gears (usually 6 on my Creo!), every time I stop and start again. Less experienced riders can also be intimidated by gear-shifting, so it's a nice accessibility feature as well.

It took a bit of getting used to; I first tried it in a very hilly place, and it was especially confusing. Some tips:

* Use [the "boost" button](bikes.md#boost-button) liberally on uphills, and when starting from a stop.
* The gears shift based on your speed (not cadence, or torque).
* Sometimes you'll have started slowing down on an uphill, pressing hard on the pedals and making little progress turning them, and it won't have down-shifted yet, which can be frustrating.
* Eventually, you will slow down enough, and it will shift down
* Also, reiterating: I recommend just laying on the boost button when climbing.
* I spent some time in the app micro-managing the speeds at which it would shift into each gear. After a bunch of thrashing, I think I ended up back at almost exactly the factory defaults ðŸ˜‚ (having also learned the glory of the turbo button).

## "Peace of Mind" plan: theft protection, insurance, maintenance

[VanMoof's "Peace of Mind" plan](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/peace-of-mind) gives you 3 years of theft protection, insurance, and maintenance for $690. It's not the cheapest, but knowing that I have backup if anything goes wrong is very reassuring, and it's the kind of offering I expect other brands to move toward as well.

If your bike gets stolen, [VanMoof's "bike hunters"](https://www.vanmoof.com/shop/en_it/bikehunters) will try to recover it in 2wks, or replace it for you.

## Internal Locking

VanMoofs have a lock inside the bike. You engage it by pushing a button on the frame, and disengage it from the app on your phone.

It doesn't stop someone from picking the bike up and throwing it in the back of a truck, but the bike does make an alarm sound if moved while locked, and VanMoofs have a few other forms of DRM (including a tracking chip and ["bike hunters" team](https://www.vanmoof.com/shop/en_it/bikehunters)) that hopefully make them less attractive to thieves.

## Reliability / Shop Proximity

A common refrain on [r/vanmoof](https://www.reddit.com/r/VanMoof/) is that you should be prepared to take it to the shop for tune-ups or troubleshooting.

I've had to go in once because we transferred ownership of the bike between VanMoof accounts, and it ended up stuck in "EU mode" (with a top speed of 20kph, instead of the US's 20mph). It was easy enough to fix in the shop. I've popped in a few times when I was in the neighborhood to have them try to make my brakes less squeaky (with mixed results), or just to top up my charge a bit.

## Shipping

I've observed them to quote a 2-3mo timeframe for shipping, only to have the bike show up in a couple weeks!

## Range

* I get â‰ˆ30mi to a charge, using the "boost button" liberally.
* I'll receive [a "PowerBank" extra battery](https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/electric-bikes/powerbank) in the next few weeks which I expect will increase my range to â‰ˆ50-60mi.
* A full recharge takes a few hours.

I stayed in a friend's apt for 2wks via VanMoof:

It worked well through the winter:

I take it to Central Park pretty regularly, with picnic/Aerobie gear:

I also occasionally do [grocery runs](reflections.md#pov-grocery-runs) with it:
