# Brompton Electric
Bromptons are a famous British folding bike, and with the [the Brompton Electric](https://us.brompton.com/bikes/brompton-electric)
they did a pretty good job engineering a motor and battery onto the front. I bought mine from [Redbeard Bikes](https://g.page/RedbeardBikes) in Brooklyn (delightful store run by a couple who have been very helpful through my process).

## Pros

* Most compact fold of all bikes (electric or not!); relatively portable ([fits in an airplane overhead bin!](https://www.google.com/search?q=brompton+overhead+bin&tbm=isch), though [flying with ebike batteries either requires special permission or is impossible](getting-started.md#flying)).
* [Half-folded "shopping cart" mode can be pushed around in stores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m91tfT4AMLY).
* Surprisingly nice ride / feels like a normal bike (despite looking a bit flimsy/silly due to small 16" wheels).
* Decent extra battery story for increased range; currently my 2nd highest range ebike (after the [Creo](bikes.md#creo)) as a result.
* Great mix of fun/whimsy with real transportation / portability / overall utility.

## Cons

* Expensive ($3800) for relatively small amount of bicycle/machine. They're well-made, so I felt it was worth it (once I'd covered other ebike use cases), but the price point is simply too high for most people I talk to.
* Supply chain has been especially backed up since COVID.
* Still a bit heavy to lug around (32lbs just the bike, 38 w/ battery, 40 with a rack).
