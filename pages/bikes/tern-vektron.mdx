# Tern Vektron Q9
The [Tern Vektron Q9](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/bikes/471/vektron-q9) was my first ebike, from [Bfold](https://goo.gl/maps/BTfhfQWMpm5BVMt97), a delightful bike store in the East Village (David was really helpful at talking me through the market when I was starting from zero).

I also test rode a Vektron at [Propel](https://g.page/propel-bikes-brooklyn) in Brooklyn, who had a very slick appointment-booking flow and beautiful inventory of Reise & Muller bikes. [Their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LIElectricBikes) is also an excellent source of ebike info; [here's their review of the Vektron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWhOQxky0lo).

## Pros

* High-quality + rugged; Bosch motor system is premium.
* Folding, cargo, and electric are hard to find in one bike.
* The Vektron is the only model I know that does a good job at all 3.
* See ["Grocery Runs"](reflections.md#pov-grocery-runs).
* Nice folded+rolling mode ([demo video](https://youtu.be/mi_3ZMbkufU?t=2057)).
* One size fits most (4'9"â€“6'5"); good [telescoping seat post](https://youtu.be/mi_3ZMbkufU?t=515), [adjustable handlebar/stem system](https://youtu.be/mi_3ZMbkufU?t=605).

## Cons

* Expensive ($3200): it's obviously a heavy-duty machine, so it's clearer what you are paying for, but that's still sticker-shock-inducing for most people
* Heavy (49lbs): again, this is understandable given its sturdy build and cargo-hauling emphasis, but you don't want to carry it up stairs
* Still large when folded: it folds in half (as opposed to the Brompton's thirds), folded footprint is more "corner of room" than "under desk".
* A minor annoyance is that the battery recharge socket is blocked by the frame, so you basically have to take the battery off of the frame to charge it. It's pretty easy to do though and not a big deal, to me.
